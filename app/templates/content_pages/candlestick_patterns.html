        These candlesticks have no wicks. White Marubozu candlesticks represent bullish candles. This occurs when the open price is the same as the lowest price and that the close price is equal to the highest price. Black Marubozu candlesticks  represent bearish candles. This occurs when the open price is equal to the highest price and that the close price is equal to the lowest price. These candlesticks are shown below.

      <h1>Doji Candlesticks</h1>
      <p>
        The Doji candlesticks are those that open and close at the same price. As a result, the body of the candle is reduced to a thin line, instead of a rectangle. These sorts of candles imply that there has been indecision or struggle between buyers and sellers, as neither one of them was able to gain control of price. There are four main types of Doji candles:
      </p>
      <div class="content_list">
        <ul>
          <li>Gravestone Doji
            <ul>
              <li>The gravestone has a long wick on the top and no real body. The bottom wick is small or absent. The large top wick represents rejection of a higher price, therefore denoting bearish sentiment.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Long-Legged Doji
            <ul>
              <li>The long-legged doji is shaped in the form of a cross where both the top and bottom wicks are roughly equally long. This type of candlestick indicates that neither the buyers nor sellers have had their say, therefore, denoting uncertainty in market trend.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Dragonfly Doji
            <ul>
              <li>The dragonfly doji has a long bottom wick with no real. The top wick is either small or absent. The large top wick represents rejection of a lower price, therefore denoting bullish sentiment.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Four Prince Doji
            <ul>
              <li>The 4 Price Doji is a horizontal line with no visible wicks. This candlestick shows that the open, close, low and high price are all the same. This represents significant indecision in market price.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          Hammer and Hanging Man Candlesticks
        </h1>
        <p>
          The inverted hammer and shooting star patterns look similar, but the difference between them depends on whether you are in an uptrend or downtrend. An inverted hammer is a bullish reversal candlestick, whereas a shooting star is a bearish reversal candlestick.

          Engulfing Candles
        </h1>
        <p>
          The bullish and bearish engulfing candlestick patterns are two candlestick reversal patterns. The bullish engulfing candlestick pattern indicates that a strong move up may occur. This typically occurs when there is a bearish candle immediately followed a bullish candle that ‘engulfs’ the bearish candle. The bearish engulfing candlestick pattern indicates that a strong move down may occur. This typically occurs when a bullish candle is immediately followed by a bearish candle that ‘engulfs’ the bullish candle.

          Tweezer Tops and Bottoms
        </h1>
        <p>
          Tweezer tops and bottoms are another set of two candlestick reversal patterns. These patterns usually occur after a recent extended up or down trend. As seen in the figure below, the patterns they form look like tweezers. The patterns occur when the first candlestick is the same as the overall trend, and the second is the opposite of the overall trend.  The bottom wicks of each of the candlesticks should be of near-equal length.
        </p>

          Evening and Morning Stars
        </h1>
        <p>
          Evening and morning stars are three candlestick reversal patterns that typically occur at the end of a trend. For the evening star, the first candle will be bullish, followed by a second candle, bearish or bullish with a small body, indicating indecision, lastly followed by a bearish candle that closes beyond the midpoint of the first candle. The morning star pattern is the opposite of this.

          Three White Soldiers and Black Crows
        </h1>
        <p>
          The three white soldiers and black crows is another set of three candlestick reversal patterns. The three white soldiers pattern occurs when there are three long bullish candles that follow a downtrend. The second of these candles should be bigger than the first candle’s body and should close near its high. This typically is a very strong indication of reversal, especially after an extended downtrend or short period of consolidation. The three black crows pattern is the opposite of the three white soldiers pattern.
